**ArchDo Paints**

ArchDo Paints is an AI-powered AR home improvement application designed to assist users in planning and visualizing their painting projects based on their personality types. The app integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT for conversational interaction and an Aptos payment gateway for secure and fast transactions. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend leverages Django and React.js.
